# Opinion_Dynamics_Models_Homophilic_Networks
Models of opinion dynamics in homophilic networks.

Generating symmetric homophilic graphs using the script generate_homophilic_graph_symmetric in https://github.com/frbkrm/NtwPerceptionBias.
Measure mean opinions when used two groups with the same fraction of nodes, in function of similitude, to multiple model
Already implemented:

  Majority rule (Whithout external influence)
 
 To be implemented and gather results:
 
  Majority rule (External influence. Stubbornes. Edge removal and addition. Higher influence with someone with equal opinion. Influence attribute dependent.
                Local iterations. Anti-Majority(Hipsters). Atribute dependant influence. Resource allocation like influence)
